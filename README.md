# atom html-to-css package

Generates CSS boilerplate based on the selected HTML.

Early & opinionated version:
 - Only cares about classes, ignores id's/other possible selectors
 - Outputs flat CSS structure
 - ... with optional classless first-child element nesting
 - Indents with 2 spaces
 - Made primarily to simplify working with BEM methodology

Future: I'll extend it with different transformers/formatters as settings. Contributions welcomed.
